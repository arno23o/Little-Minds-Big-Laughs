New Yorker Cartoon Work for Little Minds, Big Laughs Research Project: Using Small LLMs + Context for Humor Detection

Research Project Summary:
Humor detection is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) due to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of humor. This paper explores methods to improve humor detection in smaller-sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B and Llama 3 8B, by incorporating context.
